# GUI-Dictionary
GUI Dictionary with backend connectivity to database for storing recently searched words using Python 3.6  
The project uses the json dictionary dataset to retrieve the meaning of word entered by user in an 
interactive GUI & shows more than 1 meaning of words, if available.  
It shows the count of number of meanings found along with meanings.  
It also suggests the close match of words if the word is entered incorrectly and asks the user through pop up box
if the user wants to retrieve meaning of that close matched word instead.  
Other features includes Backend connectivity with sqlite3 database for storing the searched words.  
A history column shows the recently searched words & is updated in real time.  
Other features include a menu bar having option to show history of searched words.
